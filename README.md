# Hi, Iâ€™m Sasha

## Iâ€™m a system-level developer. I specialize in building low-level tools and utilities using C++, Python, and Assembly. I focus on direct control over the system, creating fast, minimal, and functional software with a focus on performance and transparency

#### Currently self-educating and experimenting in systems programming, scripting, and reverse engineering. I often develop utilities for Windows: network tools, bots, CLI interfaces, data sniffers, and process monitors

#### Occasionally, I participate in experimental coding projects and prototypes to push limits and build tools under constrained time or resources

### ðŸ’» Current Focus

- System-level utilities for Windows
- Process monitoring and memory inspection
- Terminal-based interfaces and CLI tools
- File hashing, network scanning, and I/O scripting
- Discord/Telegram bots with system control features

---

### ðŸ§  Learning Goals

- Better control over Windows internals
- Advanced C++ patterns and memory management
- Python performance optimization
- Assembly-level understanding of boot, system calls and low-level interfaces

### ðŸ›  Sample Projects

> _Repos coming soon â€” Iâ€™m currently polishing and organizing my toolset._

- `process-spy`: Lightweight process watcher with logging
- `wifi-dump`: Extractor for saved Wi-Fi credentials (Windows)
- `port-scan-x`: Fast asynchronous port scanner
- `file-hasher`: Drag-n-drop hash generator with GUI
